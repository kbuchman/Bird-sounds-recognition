# Commits naming convention

To keep your history clean and easy to read, use the following pattern to name your commits:

> type: Subject - Brief description of changes

where the commit types are:

- feat: -> new feature
- fix: -> bug fix
- style: -> styling
- refactor: -> code refactoring
- test: -> testing
- docs: -> documentation
- chore: -> regular code maintenance

#### Remember to use the imperative mood in the message, start writing the subject and description in capital letters.

### | example:

Situation:
Fixed an error with an incorrectly written loop in the cross-validation method.

#### incorrect:

> soo I've fixed some invalid code in the crossvalidation 

#### correct:

> fix: Crossvalidation method - Repair incorrect loop logic
